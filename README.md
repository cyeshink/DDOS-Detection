# DDOS-Detection
This is a program to analyze log files and detect if a DDOS has been attempted.

# Opening the App
In its current stage, the app depends on cursory files that are contained in the entire repository's folder structure, so keep the .exe file where it is when you downloaded it. Simply run the .exe file to open the application.

# Selecting a file
After you've opened the application, you'll want to select either a log file or a .daf file. If you select a log file the analysis will be performed, then a .daf file will be generated, and the results will be displayed. If you select a .daf (DDOS Analysis File), which contains the results of a previous analysis, then the results will be displayed. 

# Max Entries Field

# Text size Field
